# Cataract_Uveitis

Summary: The goal is to understand the factors influencing surgical and visual outcomes after
cataract surgery among patients with uveitis and to evaluate whether the use of prophylactic
corticosteroids is helpful in improving such outcomes.

Significance: Uveitis represents the 5th or 6th leading cause of blindness in the US and affects
more working-class/younger individuals than other common causes of vision loss in the US.
Cataract and the need for cataract surgery are common complications that uveitis patients face
and often, the cataract surgery is more complex than the typical case. Given the potential for
increased complexity of the surgery, it is important to understand whether eyes affected by
uveitis have worse surgical and visual outcomes after cataract surgery. It is clear that this
important question could be addressed in the IRIS Registry database and that this proposal
adequately outlines the gaps in the current state of the literature about outcomes after
cataract surgery in uveitis patients.

Innovation: A better understanding of the scope of outcomes of cataract surgery among
patients with uveitis will lead to knowledge of what factors contribute to better visual
outcomes and also which factors contribute to poorer visual outcomes. A better understanding
of the role of prophylactic corticosteroids in these patients will help to maximize the
risk/benefit ratio for these patients and could either prevent post-operative complications (if
corticosteroids are beneficial) or avoid corticosteroid-related side effects (if corticosteroids are
not necessary). 

Research plan: The investigator plans to quantitate the proportion of uveitic eyes undergoing
cataract surgery that achieve 20/40 or better visual acuity 3 months after surgery, evaluate the
demographic factors associated with good visual outcomes in these eyes.
